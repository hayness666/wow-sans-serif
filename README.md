# WoW Sans-Serif Font

This replaces all core in-game fonts in World of Warcraft with **Liberation Sans**, a free, open-source font that closely matches Arial.

Originally made in 2021 for WoW Classic. Updated and released publicly for easy use.

## Purpose

This font override is mainly for **visual accessibility**.

It offers a uniform, modern, readable, and consistent look that helps players read text more easilyâ€”or in some cases, makes the game playable at all.

Replacing the default stylized fonts with **Liberation Sans** improves readability for players who:
- Have dyslexia or other reading disabilities
- Experience discomfort or difficulty reading thin, irregular, overly decorative, or serif fonts
- Need consistent letter spacing and character shapes
- Otherwise benefit from a clean, sans-serif typeface for comfort and clarity

## What it does

Overrides the default World of Warcraft fonts:

| WoW Font Role        | Overridden Filename |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| UI text (menus, UI)  | `FRIZQT__.TTF`      |
| Unit names           | `SKURRI.TTF`        |
| Chat / tooltips      | `ARIALN.TTF`        |
| Mail / quest headers | `MORPHEUS.TTF`      |


## Installation

1. [Download the latest release ZIP](https://github.com/hayness666/wow-serif-font/releases)

2. Extract the `Fonts/` folder
3. Drop the **Fonts** folder directly into your WoW install directory  
   (same folder as `Interface`, `WTF`, etc.)
4. Launch the game. Fonts will be replaced globally.

No addons or Lua needed. Pure font swap.
